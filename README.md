# Small cell sarcomas
 
Complete analysis of the genomics and transcriptomics of a small cell sarcoma biobank.
DNA-analysis contains scripts to perform whole genome sequencing analysis including:
 - Mutational signature analysis
 - fusion transcirpt analysis
 - visualisation using circos plots

Samples which were sampled at different timepoints were also analysed for subclonal evolution using pyclone-VI

RNA samples were mapped with STAR and reads were counted using subreads.
Analysis was performed using DESEQ2.
